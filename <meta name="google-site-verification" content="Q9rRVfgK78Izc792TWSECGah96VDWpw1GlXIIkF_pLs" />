## 🚀 Executive Summary
Zeeta AI 7.1 represents the latest evolution in adaptive intelligence. Moving beyond static large language models, this project introduces a truly agentic and context-aware ecosystem. Version 7.1 introduces the **"Cognitive Sync"** framework—allowing the AI to understand multi-layered user intent and execute complex workflows with minimal supervision.

## 🛠 Key Upgrades in Version 7.1
* **Advanced Reasoning Engine (ARE):** A custom-tuned logic layer that reduces hallucinations by 40% using "Chain-of-Verification."
* **Zero-Shot Tool Integration:** Interfaces with external APIs and proprietary databases in real-time.
* **Multimodal Fluidity:** Unified stream processing for text, code, images, and video.

## 🏗 Technical Infrastructure
Zeeta AI 7.1 utilizes a **Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture to significantly reduce latency while maintaining high intelligence.
